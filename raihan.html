            <h3>Panic Piano</h3>
            <p>
                Piano Panic is a fun and addictive game where you use your mouse to click on falling blocks in the corresponding lane before they reach the bottom of the screen. As you progress through the game, the speed of the blocks increases and the number of blocks on the screen at once also increases, making the game more challenging.</p>

            <h3>Chef's Choice</h3>
            <p>Chefâ€™s Choice is a subscription based meal kit service where customers can order ready-to-cook meals to be sent right to their doorsteps. In each weekly package we will deliver pre-portioned ingredients alongside easy-to-follow instructions. Our food service is perfect for a wide variety of audience: from students planning to cook their own meals to a family looking for a perfect Sunday night meal; from busy housewives wondering what to make for dinner to children surprising their parents on their wedding anniversary; from young children learning how to cook to a young couple looking to try something new on a home date. We also provide a variety of different food options to suit everyoneâ€™s preferences. For instance a choice of diet like carnivore or vegetarian, a certain type of culinary from all around the world, or even other options like low calorie meals or lactose free alternatives. The customers are free to choose what they would like to have on their plates for the meal, and they can also enjoy the simple and fun process of cooking it themselves.
